# Gasless Transaction Forwarder

## Project Overview
This project implements a **Gasless Transaction Forwarder**, allowing users to send ERC-20 and ERC-721 transactions without holding ETH. The system consists of a forwarder smart contract, a backend relay service, and a frontend interface for users to interact with the system.

## Architecture
The solution consists of three main components:

1. **Smart Contracts** (Solidity):
   - `GaslessForwarder.sol`: The core contract that relays transactions on behalf of users.
   - `MockRecipient.sol`: A sample contract for testing the forwarder's functionality.

2. **Backend** (Go):
   - Responsible for relaying signed transactions to the blockchain.
   - Handles user requests for balance and transaction history.

3. **Frontend** (React/React Native):
   - Provides a simple UI for users to input transaction details and submit them for forwarding.

---

## Features
- **Gasless Transactions:** Users can send transactions without needing ETH.
- **Multi-token Support:** Supports both ERC-20 and ERC-721 tokens.
- **User-friendly UI:** Simple interface to input and track transactions.
- **Security:** Implements signature verification to ensure transaction authenticity.
- **Auditable:** Designed to achieve a high Solidity Shield audit score.

## Setup Guide

### Environment Variables

#### Contracts
Create a `.env` file in the `contracts` directory with the following content:
```
SEPOLIA_URL=https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/02084dda02bc47f78913a11ea476be56
DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY=your_secret_deployer_private_key
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=K1PCV6JTTPBVJBGNBPRNWED435CVBH5AJD
```

#### Backend
Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory with the following content:
```
INFURA_RPC_URL=https://sepolia.infura.io/v3/02084dda02bc47f78913a11ea476be56
FORWARDER_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x8336Fe9c782C385D888DA4C3549Aa3AADb801FAC
RELAYER_PRIVATE_KEY=you_relayer_private_secret_key
PORT=4000
PRIVATE_KEY=you_relayer_private_secret_key
CHAIN_ID=11155111
ERC721_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x8336Fe9c782C385D888DA4C3549Aa3AADb801FAC
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=K1PCV6JTTPBVJBGNBPRNWED435CVBH5AJD
```


### Prerequisites

```bash
git clone <repo_url>
cd Gasless-Forwarder-main
```

### 2. Smart Contracts
```bash
cd contracts
npm install
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <network>
```

### 3. Backend
```bash
cd backend
go mod tidy
go run main.go
```

### 4. Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Privacy Measures
- **Off-chain Signing:** Users sign transactions off-chain to avoid exposing private keys.
- **Data Minimization:** Only necessary transaction data is stored.
- **Secure Relayer:** Ensures transactions are relayed securely without tampering.

---

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** React, React Native, TailwindCSS
- **Backend:** Go, Gin framework
- **Smart Contracts:** Solidity, Hardhat
- **Blockchain:** Ethereum, MetaMask integration
- **Security:** ECDSA signature verification

---

## Security Considerations
- **Signature Verification:** Ensures transactions are authorized by the sender.
- **Reentrancy Protection:** Smart contracts are safeguarded against reentrancy attacks.
- **Gas Optimization:** Efficient contract design to minimize gas costs.
